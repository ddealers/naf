<b>Only a name...</b>
<p>
I am Andrew Marshall. I say this several times a day to reassure myself. There is a distressingly large number of Andrew Marshalls in the world, you see, and quite a few are writers and journalists. There is another one who works for <i>The Independent</i>, writing features (though of course he doesn't think of himself as the other one. He thinks of himself as The One, and me as the other one). Another one writes from Bangkok. A third is the Reuters correspondent in Frankfurt.
</td><td>
There's a famous one who writes comedies, and an influential American one who is a Pentagon bigwig and strategic thinker.
<br>
A few weeks ago, I was going through immigration control in the U.S., and became uneasily aware that there was more than the usual interest in my passport. At last, the eagle-eyed immigration official produced the stamps and did the business. But he told me that there is another, naughty Andrew Marshall who would be in deep trouble if he should try to re-enter America. Andrew Marshalls of the world, beware.
