"Last week we went to New York Zoo. We had a great time, it was fantastic.<br> 
<sub>1</sub><input size=9 name="q1a">, we went to see the parrots and the flamingoes. They were really<br>
beautiful and the parrots made an incredible noise! <sub>2</sub><input size=9 name="q1b">, we had lunch<br>
sitting in front of the leopards. They were having their lunch as well - I think I preferred mine!<br>
In the afternoon we went to see the elephants. <sub>3</sub><input size=9 name="q1c">, we saw the apes <br>
and monkeys. They were in a cage next to the elephants. They were playing a<br>
lot of games&#151;it was really funny. <sub>4</sub><input size=9 name="q1d"> we sat on the main lawn for a<br>
while and had an ice cream. <sub>5</sub><input size=9 name="q1e">, we went to the giftshop and I brought <br>
some postcards, including the one of the lion I'm writing this on." <br>
