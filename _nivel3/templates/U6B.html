<b>Angela's Ashes</b>
</center>
<p>
Based on the Pulitzer-prize winning novel by Frank McCourt, Angela's Ashes is the latest movie by director Alan Parker (Evita, Mississippi Burning). Set in Ireland in the 30's and 40's, the movie tells the story of Frank's childhood and adolescence in rural Ireland.<p>The movie opens with Frank's family living in Brooklyn. When Frank's baby sister dies, the family decides to give up a poor and difficult life in America and return to Ireland. <p>Parker's movie is faithful to the book, consisting of a series of episodes in Frank's life rather than a continuous narrative. Although it's a dramatic and moving story, it's told with humor and optimism. Robert Carlyle, who recently starred as the bad guy in the new James Bond movie, plays Frank's lovable but heavy-drinking father, and English actress Emily Watson plays his mother. <p>Parker's movie is a classic "rites of passage" movie. In a key scene, Frank's father takes the boy to the pub for the first time, marking young Frank's acceptance into the adult world. The action is helped along by music from guitarist and composer John Williams. <p>Angela's Ashes follows the recent trend of adapting successful novels for movies. But is it as good as the book? Parker wisely avoids the temptation to romanticize the family's difficult life, but he fails to recreate the atmosphere and spirit of McCourt's writing. <p>Hollywood directors love successful novelists and pay millions to adapt their books for the screen. However, it can be extremely difficult to match the quality of prize-winning books like Frank McCourt's. Many people will enjoy Alan Parker's movie. But they would enjoy the book more. <p>
