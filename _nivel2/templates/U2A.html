<b>... and here is this week's "EXCITING MOMENTS" letter from Spain.</b>
</p>
<p>
My son Harry was born two weeks early. Jean, my wife, suddenly had stomach pains. 
We went in the car to the hospital. 
We were driving through the downtown and Jean called out; 
"The baby is coming!" I stopped the car and helped my wife. I was very nervous and worried.
I was holding the baby when the ambulance arrived. Fortunately the baby and my wife were fine.

<tr><td>Dear Lucy,<p>
I like my new job but last week something unexpected happened. 
I was working at night in my office on the tenth floor and suddenly the lights went out. The elevator wasn't working. 
I went to the fire escape door but it was locked. I went to the window. 
For three hours I was throwing pieces of paper out the window to people in the street. 
On the pieces of paper I wrote: Help! I can't get out! Call the police! 
Finally someone read a piece of paper and phoned the police. I was very tired and angry by then. 
The next day the people at work .....
