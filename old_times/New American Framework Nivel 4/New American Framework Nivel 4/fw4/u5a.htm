<b>Shepherd's miracle escape&#151;thanks to his nose and his cell phone</b>
<p>
An emergency telephone operator couldn't believe her ears when a man telephoned using a cell phone.
 "I'm hanging off the edge of a mountain," he said.
 "If you are hanging off a mountain, how have you dialed this number?" she asked.
<p>
"I have pressed the redial button with my nose," screamed the shepherd. 
<p>
Finally, the operator was convinced and a helicopter was sent to rescue Christian Raymond, 23,
 in the Dent de Crolles region of the French Alps.

Christian was with his sheep at over 2,000 meters, when he discovered that two of the sheep were trapped on the mountain. "To rescue them, I started walking down a grassy hill. It had been raining and the grass was wet. I slipped and started falling towards the edge of the mountain."
<p>
Many French shepherds carry cell phones for safety and Christian had memorized the emergency rescue number. But after he called the emergency operator, the connection failed. Christian slipped again and fell closer to the edge.
<p>
"In order not to fall, I was holding on to a rock with both hands. I was very close to the edge," he said. Luckily, Christian's cell phone had also fallen down the hill. Incredibly, it stopped near his face, and he pressed the redial button with his nose.
<p>
The rescue has caused a sensation in France. It's also an advertising gift to cell phone companies.
